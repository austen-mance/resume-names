1. NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate element: {"method":"id","selector":"FirstName"} (basically, Firefox doesn't know how to find the first name section. weirdly it still seems to work)
2. Currently enters city instead of ZIP code into ZIP field in biographical information, causing no biographical information to be changed
3. Stopped at the application with this error: Package not found at 'clerical/0.docx'
4. (not a bug just a note) monster profiles need to change preferences to email contact, not phone contact
