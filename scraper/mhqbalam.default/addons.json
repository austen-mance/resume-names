So it can take some time to appear.\n\nQ: What's that \"Detect Language\" thing on the menu?\n\nA: In Google's words \"(an) option to help you automatically identify the language of the text you're trying to translate\". It does what the \"Detect page language\" option was intended to do but better. If you plan to use that function you can disable \"Detect page language\" from the option menu.\n\nQ: I have \"Detect Language\" selected but nothing gets translated. What happens?\n\nA: Check if you have \"Detect browser language\" checked on the options window. Since this options overrides the destination language with the browser locale it may happen that the origin and the destination language are the same.\n\nQ: The text I wan't to translate is too long and appears uncomplete in the translation box. How can I see a complete translation?\n\nA: Click in the translation box and a new tab will be opened with the Google page with the full text.\n\nQ: When I click on the translation to open it in a new tab it just opens a white page. What happened?\n\nA: Look if you have the Image zoom extension installed. Seems like gtranslate and Image Zoom doesn't fit well together. To solve the problem, uninstall and re-install Image Zoom. If you still have the problem please contact me with the list of installed extensions.\n\nQ: How can I contact the author?\n\nA: bonjour+gtranslate@pierrebertet.net","reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gtranslate/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":501,"totalDownloads":4487497,"weeklyDownloads":3009,"dailyUsers":86693,"updateDate":1450421212000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/bpierre/gtranslate/issues"},{"id":"tabscope@xuldev.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/4/4882-32.png?modified=1374254174","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/4/4882-64.png?modified=1374254174"},"name":"Tab Scope","type":"extension","version":"1.6.2.1-signed","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Gomita","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/gomita/?src=api"},"description":"Preview and navigate tab contents through popup.","fullDescription":"Shows a popup on tabs and enables you to preview and navigate tab contents through popup.
